# YOLOv3-TF2
 
This is a modified verison of YOLOv3 that [Roboflow](https://github.com/roboflow/keras-yolo3) uses for training.
It has been converted using [Tensorflow's migration tool](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/migrate) for migrating projects from Tensorflow v1.x to Tensorflow v2.x.
Additional changes were made to 'convert.py' and 'yolo3/model.py' in order to get them running in a Google Colab notebook.
